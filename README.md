Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Check the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder, bundling React in production mode and optimizing for performance. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes for cache busting. Your app is then ready for deployment.
